v Remove unneeded changes

v params to preProcess (aEOS 1... N/sessions len, gen dir, name Dir)
v Preprocess 1... N + session len

v enable preprocess recsys

param to process
add option to work on exiting result (from csv? in a raw?)
implement random by probability threshold  (th = 0.1...1)
implement random by train session len
run random based on earlier results csv

push up results
evaluation support in -1... -n
Evaluation measures for 1...k (P@k, mrr@k)

Add print to File
short Run on EC2 GPU - compare runTime

try Colab

Document the run in EC2
load db from web ZIP
Load --> Train --> Run --> save in one command

run on recsys64 on all aEOS N
Find best N aEOS

run all algos on all dbs - reproduce  regular results reported by papers (gen p@1..20  mrr@1...20)
run all algos using N on all dbs (gen p@1..20  mrr@1...20)
run all algos using random (th = 0.1...1)  and (session len) (gen p@1..20  mrr@1...20)

Compare
graphs...
aEOS vs random (is aEOS better than random)
aEOS vs original (how much aEOS fail tha algo)

Check:
Random - set seed = 42 in all places
